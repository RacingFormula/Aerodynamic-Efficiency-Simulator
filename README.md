# Aerodynamic-Efficiency-Simulator
## Overview

The Aerodynamic Efficiency Simulator is an advanced modelling tool designed to evaluate the aerodynamic performance of vehicles. By analysing parameters such as drag, downforce, and airflow distribution, this tool provides insights into vehicle stability, efficiency, and performance at varying speeds.

## Features

- **Drag and Downforce Modelling**: Simulates aerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle.
- **Speed-Based Analysis**: Evaluates aerodynamic efficiency across a range of speeds.
- **Customisable Parameters**: Supports adjustments for wing angles, ride height, and drag coefficients.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates lift-to-drag ratios, energy consumption, and speed stability.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generates detailed plots for aerodynamic forces and efficiency metrics.
